**AngusInfra** is a rapid development foundational framework based on SpringBoot. It aims to
simplify and accelerate the development process of multi-tenant applications, enabling developers to
build scalable, secure, and maintainable server-side applications more efficiently.

## **Core Features**

- ðŸŒŸ **OpenAPI Support**: Strict compliance with OpenAPI specifications ensures broad community support for API development and management.

- ðŸŒŸ **Multi-Tenancy Architecture**: Designed as a shared-datasource multi-tenant system, AngusInfra simplifies management and reduces hardware/operational costs while ensuring robust data isolation and security.

- ðŸŒŸ **SpringBoot Foundation**: Built on SpringBoot with business-oriented extensions, it delivers powerful backend capabilities, leverages a mature ecosystem, and accelerates development workflows.

- ðŸŒŸ **Rapid Development**: Pre-built components and modules enable developers to quickly scaffold applications, cutting development cycles significantly.
  - ðŸš€ **Generic Business Logic**: Standardized templates for high-frequency business scenarios reduce redundant code by over 50%.
  - ðŸš€ **Rich Utilities**: Out-of-the-box APIs for data conversion, validation, and enhanced wrappers for mainstream middleware (Cache/Database/Remote) boost development efficiency by 50%.

- ðŸŒŸ **Extensibility**: Modular architecture allows flexible customization of business logic and user interfaces to meet project-specific needs.

- ðŸŒŸ **Security-First Design**: Integrated authentication and authorization mechanisms (OAuth2, API Key, etc.) safeguard user data and application integrity.
